A simple script to detect changes in the LC_COLLATE files supplied by
your operating system, that PostgreSQL depends on for implementing
'collations'.

Depedencies: python, python-psycopg2

When collation definitions change, btree indexes can become corrupted
as the ordering of strings can change.  This script can generate
appropriate REINDEX commands to repair that type of corruption, and,
optionally, run the commands.

See the output of check_pg_collations --help for more information.

If no changes are detected since last time, it prints and does
nothing.  If changes are detected, or if it hasn't run before, or
detects that your database has started using a locale that it hasn't
checksummed before, it rebuilds all dependent indexes.  Here is an
example of the output of the script:

-- Collation en_GB.UTF-8 has changed.  Rebuilding index(es)...
REINDEX INDEX public.lc_collate_checksums_pkey;
REINDEX INDEX pg_catalog.pg_shseclabel_object_index;
REINDEX INDEX pg_catalog.pg_seclabel_object_index;
-- Collation fr_FR.utf8 not previously checksummed.  Rebuilding index(es) just to be sure...
REINDEX INDEX public.multi;
REINDEX INDEX public.foo1_french_key;
-- Recording locale checksum and other metadata for next time...
INSERT INTO public.lc_collate_checksums (lc_collate, path, modified, checksum) VALUES ('fr_FR.utf8', '/usr/lib/locale/fr_FR.utf8/LC_COLLATE', pg_catalog.to_timestamp('1440971614'), '5aee00a13cb3e717fd8cb6dbfc5ebd4c');
UPDATE public.lc_collate_checksums SET path = '/usr/lib/locale/en_GB.utf8/LC_COLLATE', modified = pg_catalog.to_timestamp('1440971614'), checksum = '5aee00a13cb3e717fd8cb6dbfc5ebd4c' WHERE lc_collate = 'en_GB.UTF-8';
